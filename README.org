** Introduction
This repository contains various simple [[https://openscad.org/][OpenSCAD]] models for printing. In most cases you'll need to adjust parameters for your specific use case. For the few model where standard parameters make sense you'll find a STL on printables.

** Fans
*** BGEARS Aerocool B Blaster 120mm fan brackets
[[./fans/bgears_fan_bracket.scad][bgears_fan_bracket.scad]] allows connecting several BGEARS Aerocool B Blaster 120mm fan into one big block and/or mounting it to something. STLs are available on [[https://www.printables.com/model/225105-fan-brackets-for-bgears-aerocool-b-blaster][printables]].
** Mounting
This section contains various simple adapters to mount random items to others.
*** Mainboard standoffs
[[./mounting/mainboard_standoffs.scad][mainboard_standoffs.scad]] defines a simple standoff for mounting holes the mainboard has, but the case is missing. They should friction fit into the mainboard screw holes, and optionally can be secured with a M3 screw.
*** Raaco drawer shims
[[./mounting/raaco_drawer_shim_top.scad][raaco_drawer_shim_top.scad]] and [[./mounting/raaco_drower_shim.scad][raaco_drawer_shim.scad]] are shims to friction fit the raaco container grids from [[https://www.printables.com/model/479356][this collection]] into a common workshop drawer. [[./mounting/raaco_drawer_shims.3mf][raaco_drawer_shims.3mf]] has a pair of each shim mirrored and rotated to be printed on a mk3/mk4 print bed.
*** Magnet shims
[[./mounting/magnet_shim.scad][magnet_shim.scad]] is the size of common rubberized magnets with M4 thread, and can be used to balance larger plates mounted with only few magnets.

** Vacuum adapters
*** Bosch GCU to central vacuum adapter
[[./mounting/bosch_cgu_adapter.scad][bosch_cgu_adapter.scad]] connects the Bosch GCU 18V-30 to a vacuum nozzle with 32mm diameter - like BEAM and some other central vacuums. It is best printed in flexible filament.

*** Central vacuum to Bosch/Electrolux/AEG/... vacuum shim
[[./vacuum/vacuum_shim.scad][vacuum_shim.scad]] can be inserted into tools belonging to standard AEG/Electrolux/... vacuums with a 35mm nozzle diameter to bring them to the size of central vacuums. It is best printed in flexible filament.

*** Replacement lid for Beam central vacuum
[[./vacuum/beam_lid.scad][beam_lid.scad]] contains a replacement flap for a vacuum socket. [[./vacuum/beam_plug.scad][beam_plug.scad]] can be used to fix the rubber seal from the original one in case the original stopper got lost or fits badly.

Detailed instruction is on [[https://www.printables.com/model/570356-beam-central-vacuum-replacement-cover][printables.]]
